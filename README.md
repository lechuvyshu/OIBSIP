# OIBSIP
This contains the three tasks assigned by Oasis Infobyte Data Science Internship. The first Task is about Iris Flower Classification. 
Iris flower has three species; setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differs according to their measurements. My task is to train a machine learning model that can learn from the
measurements of the iris species and classify them.
The second task is about Unemployment Analysis with Python. Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate which is the number of people who are unemployed as a percentage of the
total labour force. We have seen a sharp increase in the unemployment rate during Covid-19 and also the recession period. So here I analyzed the unemployment rate for the last few years.
The last task I did is about Email Spam Detection with Machine Learning. I used Python to build an email spam detector. Then, used machine learning to train the spam detector 
to recognize and classify emails into spam and non-spam.
